            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Data mining has become an integral tool in decision-making across diverse domains, including finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and smart cities. However, as data mining becomes ubiquitous, it also raises various concerns related to fairness, interpretability, privacy, and security. Ensuring that data mining is trustworthy and responsible is critical to protect individuals and meet regulatory expectations from regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. This session on Trustworthy and Responsible Data mining hopes to bring together researchers and practitioners of data mining to discuss the aforementioned concerns about data mining and will provide unique insights into the latest research addressing them. </p>
